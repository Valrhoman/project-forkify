#forkify Project

Hi! This web application was the final project in the Udemy course 'The Complete JavaScript Course 2023: From Zero to Expert!' teached by Jonas Schmedtmann. I have written these codes from following Jonas' lectures and demos.

Now about the forkify app itself, it is a "recipe" browsing application with an amazing feature where you can upload your own custom recipes. Enjoy seeing it with the link below! ðŸ˜ƒ
